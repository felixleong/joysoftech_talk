.. note::

    Why schools can't prepare you 100%

    - Everything changes **so rapidly**: there's always a promise of something
      faster, more efficient and bad-ass in the horizon -- be it tech stack,
      best practices, methodology, business trends, consumer demands etc.
    - Each company is its own unique technological beast:

        - Project management methodology
        - Technology stack
        - Reliance of third-party developers (i.e. in-house vs. outsourced
          development)
        - Quality of internal staff and code

    - Not to mention that different people have different interpretation of how
      methodology may be intepreted
    - You'll be learning the ropes, regardless of your skill level

Technobabble Samples
====================

- TDD/BDD
- Agile methodology
- Responsive design
- Cloud computing
- Devops: Automation, Continuous Integration
- Functional programming, parallel processing

Certification: Worth The Price?
===============================

.. note::

    - Makes better sense in the enterprise track *(especially the tech oriented
      ones)*
    - Some does yield great financial rewards *(Hint: SAP)*
    - Only applicable as much as corporations value them
    - Hint: Agile/SCRUM Master certification is quite valued in both corporate
      and mid-stage startups nowadays

.. note::

    - Because you'll be working w/ **humans**.
    - It makes your life smoother and lesser headaches
    - Boils down to WII.FM -- What's In It For Me

        - Learn to understand what your customer/manager wants and know to ask
          enough questions to **truly** understand them
        - Learn how to establish expectations in terms of deliverables
        - Know enough people dynamics and politics to make communications
          efficient
        - … And being assertive, firm and confident

    - Better learn up these skills when you are having your team assignments,
      **the working life is pretty much the same situation**

.. note::

    - Speciality comes in many forms:

        - Technology stack
        - Management methodology
        - Domain knowledge
        - … or even how the company runs and make things happen fast

    - The 10,000 Hours rule: i.e. it takes both talent and time to hone in your
      skills to mastery
