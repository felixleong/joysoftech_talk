.. note::

    Why schools can't prepare you 100%

    - Each company is its own unique technological beast:

        - Project management methodology
        - Technology stack
        - Reliance of third-party developers (i.e. in-house vs. outsourced
          development)

    - You'll be learning the ropes, regardless of your skill level
