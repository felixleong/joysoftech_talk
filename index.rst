          approaches, behind-the-scene infrastructure, design decisions, open
          source code

.. note::

    Why schools can't prepare you 100%

    - Each company is its own unique technological beast:

        - Project management methodology
        - Technology stack
        - Reliance of third-party developers (i.e. in-house vs. outsourced
          development)

    - Not to mention that different people have different interpretation of how
      methodology may be intepreted
    - You'll be learning the ropes, regardless of your skill level
